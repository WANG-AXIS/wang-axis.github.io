# Rapid filtration methods for dual-energy x-ray ct

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Wenxiang Cong, Yan Xi

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/8/18

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17734311

<b>Description</b>: 
Systems and method for performing X-ray computed tomography (CT) that can improve spectral separation
and decrease motion artifacts without increasing radiation dose are provided. The systems and method
can be used with either a kVp-switching source or a single-kVp source. When used with a kVp-switching
source, an absorption grating and a filter grating can be disposed between the X-ray source and the sample
to be imaged. Relative motion of the filter and absorption gratings can by synchronized to the kVp switching
frequency of the X-ray source. When used with a single-kVp source, a combination of absorption and filter
gratings can be used and can be driven in an oscillation movement that is optimized for a single-kVp X-ray
source. With a single-kVp source, the absorption grating can also be omitted and the filter grating can remain 
stationary.







# CT SUPER-RESOLUTION GAN CONSTRAINED BY THE IDENTICAL, RESIDUAL AND CYCLE LEARNING ENSEMBLE (GAN-CIRCLE)

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Chenyu You, Wenxiang Cong, Hongming Shan

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/7/21

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17564728

<b>Description</b>: 
A system for generating a high resolution ( HR ) computed tomography ( CT ) image from a low resolution ( LR ) CT
image is described . The system includes a first generative adversarial network ( GAN ) and a second GAN . The first GAN includes a first generative neural network ( G ) config ured to receive a training LR image dataset and to generate a corresponding estimated HR image dataset , and first discriminative neural network ( Dy ) configured to compare a
training HR image dataset and the estimated HR image dataset . The second GAN includes a second generative neural network ( F ) configured to receive the training HR image dataset and to generate a corresponding estimated LR image dataset , and a second discriminative neural network ( Dx ) configured to compare the training LR image dataset
and the estimated LR image dataset . The system further includes an optimization module configured to determine an optimization function based , at least in part , on at least one of the estimated HR image dataset and / or the estimated LR image dataset . The optimization function contains at least
one loss function . The optimization module is further con figured to adjust a plurality of neural network parameters associated with at least one of the first GAN and / or the
second GAN , to optimize the optimization function .
