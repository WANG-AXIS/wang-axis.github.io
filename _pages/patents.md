# Rapid filtration methods for dual-energy x-ray ct

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Wenxiang Cong, Yan Xi

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/8/18

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17734311

<b>Description</b>: 
Systems and method for performing X-ray computed tomography (CT) that can improve spectral separation
and decrease motion artifacts without increasing radiation dose are provided. The systems and method
can be used with either a kVp-switching source or a single-kVp source. When used with a kVp-switching
source, an absorption grating and a filter grating can be disposed between the X-ray source and the sample
to be imaged. Relative motion of the filter and absorption gratings can by synchronized to the kVp switching
frequency of the X-ray source. When used with a single-kVp source, a combination of absorption and filter
gratings can be used and can be driven in an oscillation movement that is optimized for a single-kVp X-ray
source. With a single-kVp source, the absorption grating can also be omitted and the filter grating can remain 
stationary.







# CT SUPER-RESOLUTION GAN CONSTRAINED BY THE IDENTICAL, RESIDUAL AND CYCLE LEARNING ENSEMBLE (GAN-CIRCLE)

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Chenyu You, Wenxiang Cong, Hongming Shan

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/7/21

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17564728

<b>Description</b>: 
A system for generating a high resolution ( HR ) computed tomography ( CT ) image from a low resolution ( LR ) CT
image is described . The system includes a first generative adversarial network ( GAN ) and a second GAN . The first GAN includes a first generative neural network ( G ) config ured to receive a training LR image dataset and to generate a corresponding estimated HR image dataset , and first discriminative neural network ( Dy ) configured to compare a
training HR image dataset and the estimated HR image dataset . The second GAN includes a second generative neural network ( F ) configured to receive the training HR image dataset and to generate a corresponding estimated LR image dataset , and a second discriminative neural network ( Dx ) configured to compare the training LR image dataset
and the estimated LR image dataset . The system further includes an optimization module configured to determine an optimization function based , at least in part , on at least one of the estimated HR image dataset and / or the estimated LR image dataset . The optimization function contains at least
one loss function . The optimization module is further con figured to adjust a plurality of neural network parameters associated with at least one of the first GAN and / or the
second GAN , to optimize the optimization function .





# DETECTION SCHEME FOR X-RAY SMALL ANGLE SCATTERING

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Guang Li, Wenxiang Cong

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/7/14

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17711171

<b>Description</b>: 
A detection scheme for x-ray small angle scattering is described. An x-ray small angle scattering apparatus may include a first grating and a complementary second grating. The first grating includes a plurality of first grating cells. The complementary second grating includes a plurality of second grating cells. The second grating is positioned relative to the first grating. A configuration of the first grating, a configuration of the second grating and the relative positioning of the gratings are configured to pass one or more small angle scattered photons and to block one or more Compton scattered photons and one or more main x-ray photons.

<b>Inventors</b>
Ge Wang, Lars Arne Gjesteby

<b>Publication date :</b> 2022/6/9

<b>Patent office :</b> US

<b>Application number</b> : 17679716

<b>Description</b>: 
Systems and methods for obtaining simultaneous X-ray—magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are provided. A magnetic resonance X-ray CT (MRX) system can combine X-ray imaging and MRI in a cost-effective and relatively simple solution for improved imaging. During imaging of a subject, the X-ray source and X-ray detector can be simultaneously rotated around the subject, and the means for generating a magnetic field can also be rotated around the subject. The means for generating a magnetic field can be a plurality of permanent magnets.
