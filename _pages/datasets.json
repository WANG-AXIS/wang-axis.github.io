    "description": "The dataset of breast CT scans using Koning system",
    "details": "The system uses a tungsten-anode mammography tube (RAD71SP, Varex Imaging) operating at 49 kV with a 1.4 mm HVL, and an amorphous silicon flat-panel detector (PaxScan 4030CB, Varex Imaging) with 768×1,024 elements (388×388 μm²). The nominal image matrix is 1,024×1,024, with slice count depending on breast size. Each voxel measures 273.43 μm³. There are 155 volumes in total—50 from Koning and 105 from the University of Arizona.",
